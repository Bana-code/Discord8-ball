# Discord8-ball
simple discord bot that is basically answers your life existence.\
(Also works with tts)\
Bot prefix is ";" without the quotation marks.
You can do ";help" without the quotation marks to find what can it do.

## How to run
### Requirements
* Python 3.6.8 or higher
* discord.py API / Wrapper
* Python IDE or Text editor
(If you don't have discord.py or python click the link above)\
[How to install discord.py and python](https://github.com/Bana-code/python-help/blob/main/README.md)
If you already installed python and discord.py proceed.
# Running it
Put your bot's token in "token.txt" file without the brackets.
Open the main.py using your IDE or Text Editor and run it.
#### (If you're using a Text Editor do this)
Open your terminal if you're on linux and mac, open cmd if you're on windows\
if you can't open terminal do ctrl + alt + t and control + option + shift + t on mac.
if on windows, do windows key + r and it should open a run window, type there cmd.\
it should open cmd.
After you opened your cmd or terminal type this:\
"python3 (your directory to main.py)" without the quotation marks and parenthesis.\
your directory should be leading to the python file, you should download the python file and put it on your desktop.\
if there's an error, you maybe you put the file somewhere else. If not then you don't have python 3.6.8 higher.\
## Disclaimer:
Obviously this bot code will not run 24/7 once you stopped the code, the bot will also stop responding.
To fix this you have to use HEROKU. Watch some Youtube tutorials out there how to set it up 24/7, I recommend you to look at TechWithTim's video.
